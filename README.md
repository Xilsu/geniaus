# Geniaus

## A Genius parody

Here are all the rules: 

* GENIAUS shows one color and its respective code.
* You must enter the right color code.
* The color is going to appear again added with another one, creating a sequence.
* You must enter both colors code correctly.
* Every time you enter the sequence correctly, a new color will be added to it.
* Keep up while you're able to remember the whole color sequence.
* The speed increases as you score.
* If you don't remember the sequence, well... you'll see what happens.

<br />

Obs. This game is runnable on Windows OS only.
